|INSTRUCTION SIGNATURE: Instruction signature is calculated adding all the           |
|instructions extended hamming code (7 bits each instruction). The difference        |
|is computed as the absolute value of the difference of both signatures.             |
|                                                                                    |
|REGISTER SIGNATURE: Register signature is calculated concatenating all the          |
|registers extended hamming code. The difference is calculated comparing one by      |
|one these values.                                                                   |

|MEMORY MAP (HISTOGRAMS): Bins of the instruction signature difference are           |
|unven. Number of bins is calculated automatically as a function of the number       |
|of instructions and the instruction coding bits.                                    |
