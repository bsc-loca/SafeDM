\section{Clocking and reset}

\subsection{Clocking}
SafeDM has a single input clock. You should connect the appropriate AHB bus clock to this clock input. 

\subsection{Resets}
SafeDM reset \textit{rstn} is an active-Low synchronous reset to the core. All registers are reset to power-on conditions. Apart from the external reset signal, SafeDM can be reset through the configuration APB register \ref{cfg0}.
