# Diversity quantifier

This modules is done for the platform De-Risc, based on the processor Noelv. This modules aim to determine whether there is or there is not diversity between two processors that can eventually execute the same set of instructions. Some circuitry is also added to gather information about the value of this signatures and plot histograms.
